			<p>Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf
			lineages that produced dogs branched off from the line that produced modern living wolves sometime between
			27,000 and 40,000 years ago. The timing and location of dog domestication is a matter of debate. There is
			strong genetic evidence, however, that the first domestication events occurred somewhere in northern Eurasia
			between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago. In this region wolves likely facilitated their own domestication by
			trailing nomadic people in northern Eurasia and consuming the remains of game animals that hunters left
			behind.</p>

			<p>Most studies agree that domestication was not a single event. It is thought to have been a process that
			unfolded over thousands of years, involving dog populations that emerged at different times in different
			regions of Eurasia. Dogs and wild wolves subsequently interbred, with early dog ​​populations being replaced
			by later populations. Some genetic studies have provided evidence of early domestication events in specific
			regions. One study suggests that wolves were domesticated in China 16,300 years ago, while another suggests
			that early dogs, dating back to approximately 12,000 to 14,000 years ago, descended from a small gray wolf
			lineage that inhabited India.</p>

			<p>Dogs have played a crucial role in the history of human civilization, being among the first domesticated
			animals. In hunter-gatherer societies, they served as hunting companions and as protection from predators.
			When livestock were domesticated approximately 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, dogs were used to herd and guard
			sheep, goats, and cattle. While many dogs still perform these roles, they are primarily used for social
			purposes and as companions. Today, dogs serve as guide dogs for the blind and disabled, and in police work.
			Nursing homes and hospitals also use dogs for therapeutic purposes to aid patient recovery. Humans have bred
			a wide variety of dog breeds, each adapted to perform a variety of functions. This has been further enhanced
			by advances in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry.</p>

			<p>As it became clear that dogs were faster, stronger, and had superior eyesight and hearing than humans, these
			traits were enhanced through crossbreeding. Middle Eastern nobles revered these agile sighthounds, and in
			Europe, powerful dogs like the Mastiff were developed to protect homes and travelers from danger.</p>
