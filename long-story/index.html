			<p>Genetic evidence suggests that dogs descended directly from wolves (Canis) and that the now-extinct wolf

			<p>Most studies agree that domestication was not a single event. It is thought to have been a process that

			<p>Dogs have played a crucial role in the history of human civilization, being among the first domesticated

			Nursing homes and hospitals also use dogs for therapeutic purposes to aid patient recovery.</p>
