	<h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>
	<h2>The difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</h2>
	<p>In CSS, length units fall into two main categories: absolute and relative. Absolute length units represent
		specific physical dimensions. The calculated value is fixed and does not change depending on factors such as the
		size of the parent element or the viewport size. And Relative length units specify lengths based on other length
		properties or characteristics of the rendering environment. The computed value varies depending on the context.
		The fundamental difference lies in how
		values ​​are determined and whether they adjust to different situations. Absolute lengths are fixed and don't
		scale with
		user settings. Relative units, on the other hand, aren't fixed. This difference can be felt when using units in
		actual CSS. </p>
	<h2>px,pt, em, rem, in, pc</h2>
	<p>px is absolute lengths. Short for pixel, 1px represents one pixel. For screen displays, it typically represents
		one device pixel (dot). However, for printers or high-resolution screens, one CSS pixel represents multiple
		device pixels.</p>
