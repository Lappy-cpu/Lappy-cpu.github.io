	<h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>
	<h2>The difference between absolute and relative CSS length units</h2>
	<p>In CSS, length units fall into two main categories: absolute and relative. Absolute length units represent
		specific physical dimensions. The calculated value is fixed and does not change depending on factors such as the
		size of the parent element or the viewport size. And Relative length units specify lengths based on other length
		properties or characteristics of the rendering environment. The computed value varies depending on the context.
		The fundamental difference lies in how
		values ​​are determined and whether they adjust to different situations. Absolute lengths are fixed and don't
		scale with
		user settings. Relative units, on the other hand, aren't fixed. This difference can be felt when using units in
		actual CSS. </p>
	<h2>px, pt, em, rem, in, pc</h2>
	<p>'px' is absolute length unit. It is short for pixel, 1px represents one pixel. One px is equal to 96th of 1 inch.
		'pt' is
		also an absolute length unit. It is short for point, and one pt represents 1 point. 1 pt is equal to 1/72 of 1
		inch.
		'em'
		is relative length unit. It's based on font and used to indicate the computed font size of an element (e.g. 2em
		means double the current
		font size). 'rem' is also relative length unit. It's based on root element's font and relative to font-size of
		the
		root element. It used to define sizes relative to the font size of the root element of the document like html
		element. "in" is an absolute length unit. It is short for inch, and one inch equals 1 inch. 1in is equal to
		2.54cm and also equals 96px. 'pc' is also an absolute length unit. It is short for pica, and one pc is equal to
		1
		pica. 1 pc is equal to 12pt, or 1 in / 6. </p>
	<p>To summarize, it's like this</p>
