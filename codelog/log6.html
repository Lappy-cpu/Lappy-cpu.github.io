    <h1>Code References</h1>
    <p>I looked up the table HTML coding part in 4 web coding site: W3Schools, CSS Tricks, web.dev, and Mozilla
        Developer Network (MDN). Here are the links for each website, the explanation of table HTML coding</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-table-element/">CSS Tricks</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/tables">web.dev</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/table">Mozilla Developer
                Network (MDN)</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Differences in the information presented on each website</h2>

    <p>First, I read and reviewed the information posted on W3Schools. The article felt quite well-organized. The
        introduction shows how table code is used and displayed, and scrolling down provides detailed instructions.
        Beyond this, you can browse the sub-lists under the HTML Tables list on the left for more detailed information
        and code examples.</p>
    <p>CSS Tricks provides detailed information in essay format. It helps even beginners easily understand the concepts,
        and even provides detailed explanations of potentially trivial details. It also provides example screens to
        demonstrate how the code works.</p>
    <p>Web.dev is notable for its Wikipedia-like structure. While it certainly contains the information necessary for
        coding, it differs from the two sites mentioned above in that it lacks the detail and breadth of information.
        (In fact, in the case of web.dev, clicking on the resource links in the introduction list takes you to the MDN
        site, which offers more detailed explanations than web.dev, so the explanations may have been a bit simplistic.)
    </p>
    <p>The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), like W3Schools, offers a wealth of information on table coding, but it
        differs in its detailed approach. While W3Schools offers a quick overview with pictures and then hands-on
        examples, MDN offers a comprehensive overview, including detailed code and examples. This approach
        differentiates MDN from other sites, and while it lacks the depth of information found on CSS Tricks, it still
        offers a significant advantage.</p>

    <h2>What features do you think a code reference page should offer?</h2>
    <p>I believe that code reference pages should provide examples. This makes it easier for even beginners to learn and
        follow along, which in turn increases the number of coders.</p>


    <textarea cols="60" rows="10">
        Of the four resources, I'd say web.dev's weakness is its lack of information. CSS Tricks's strength lies in its vast amount of information.
