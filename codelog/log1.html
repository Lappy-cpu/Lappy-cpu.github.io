	<h1>HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
	<h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
	<p>Semantic HTML tags are HTML elements that convey meaning about the content they enclose, beyond just how the
		content is displayed visually. Non-semantic tags in HTML are elements that do not convey any inherent meaning or
		describe the type of content they contain. There's a fundamental difference between non-semantic and semantic
		HTML tags: their ability to convey the meaning of the content they contain. In HTML, semantic tags are used as
		elements that clearly explain their meaning to both browsers and developers, providing structure and context to
		content. On the other hand, non-semantic tags are primarily used in CSS for layout and styling purposes, and
		thus are not used as elements that clearly explain their meaning like semantic tags. For examples:</p>
	<textarea cols="70" rows="10">
	<div>
  		<span>The list</span>
  	<div>
    	<li>one</li>
    	<li>two</li>
    	<li>three</li>
    	<li>four</li>
  	</div>
		</div>
	</textarea>

	<p>If you only use nonsemantic tags like <.div> and <.span>, your webpage won't display properly in the desired
				format. In this case, you can use semantic tags to resolve the issue. Below is how to fix it with
				semantic tags.</p>

	<textarea cols="70" rows="10">
	<header>
  		<h1>The list</h1>
	<ul>
    	<li>one</li>
   	<li>two</li>
    	<li>three</li>
    	<li>foer</li>
	</ul>
		</header>

		</textarea>

	<p>I changed the <.div> part to <.header> or <.ul>, and the <.span> part to <.h1>. You will see a cleaner and more
							properly printed text than before.</p>

	<hr>

	<h2>What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
	<p>Semantic tags offer several advantages. Within HTML, semantic tags help search engines and other user devices
		understand the importance and context of a webpage. They also improve the experience for users with disabilities
		by making web content more understandable to assistive devices like screen readers, and they help search engines
		accurately interpret and rank website content.</p>
