    <h1>Images</h1>
    <h2>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like <.img>) and presenting it as the
            background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)?</h2>
    <p>Displaying an image using an HTML tag like <.img> and using the CSS background-image property to display an
            image as the background of an HTML element are both equivalent image displays, but they differ in their code
            input. Because they share different code, the overall code input method differs. This approach, while
            seemingly similar, also results in different functionality and layouts.The <.img> HTML tag is used when an
                image is part of the content within a web page. Examples include photos in articles, product images on
                e-commerce sites, and logos. Images are also considered an essential part of the document's structure
                and
                information. The <.img> HTML tag is used when an image is part of the content within a web page. For
                    example, it's used for photos in articles, product images on e-commerce sites, and logos, and is
                    often
                    considered an essential part of the document's structure and information. In contrast, the
                    background-image CSS tag is used when an image is purely visual or decorative. This means that the
                    image
                    is not part of the core content, but rather serves only as a visual element. Examples include
                    textured
                    backgrounds for divs, icons for buttons, and banner images that aren't considered content. HTML tags
                    like the <.img> tag are often inserted as part of a web page and often occupy a significant portion
                        of it, so they have a significant direct impact on the layout. On the other hand,
                        background-images
                        are often used for decoration and don't have a significant impact on the layout, but they don't
                        affect the document flow or the size of the element they're applied to.</p>



    <h2>Besides background-image, what other CSS properties affect the display of background images?</h2>
    <p>Besides background-image, other CSS properties that affect background image display include background-repeat and
        background-size. background-repeat controls how background images are repeated. By default, background images
        are repeated horizontally and vertically to fill the entire element. background-size determines the size of the
        background image. Depending on what you add to the end of your code, you can resize the image to fit the element
        in various ways.</p>

    <p>The difference between the dimensions and resolution of a bitmap image can be defined as follows:</p>

    <textarea cols="60" rows="10">
        Dimensions is the total number of pixels, and resolution refers to the density of pixels within physical space.

		</textarea>

    <h2>GIF, PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, and SVG</h2>
    <p>These five image files can be bundled and displayed as the same image on a web page, but they differ in some
        subtle ways. GIF is a file format used to display short moving images, while PNG helps to make the background
        appear transparent when the background is transparent. JPG/JPEG are common image file formats, WebP is a file
        format used in web browsers to provide a balance of quality and small file size through lossy and lossless
        compression, and SVG is a file format used for scalable 2D graphics that must maintain quality at any size. For
        illustration, PNG and SVG are the most commonly used file formats, and these file formats are superior. PNG is
        mainly used for illustrations that require transparent backgrounds, and SVG is a file format that is useful for
        saving and uploading finished illustrations to web pages.</p>
