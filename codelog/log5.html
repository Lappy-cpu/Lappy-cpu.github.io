    <h1>Images</h1>
    <h2>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like <.img>) and presenting it as the
            background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)?</h2>
    <p>Displaying an image using an HTML tag like <.img> and using the CSS background-image property to display an
            image as the background of an HTML element are both equivalent image displays, but they differ in their code
            input. Because they share different code, the overall code input method differs. This approach, while
            seemingly similar, also results in different functionality and layouts.The <.img> HTML tag is used when an
                image is part of the content within a web page. Examples include photos in articles, product images on
                e-commerce sites, and logos. Images are also considered an essential part of the document's structure
                and
                information. The <.img> HTML tag is used when an image is part of the content within a web page. For
                    example, it's used for photos in articles, product images on e-commerce sites, and logos, and is
                    often
                    considered an essential part of the document's structure and information. In contrast, the
                    background-image CSS tag is used when an image is purely visual or decorative. This means that the
                    image
                    is not part of the core content, but rather serves only as a visual element. Examples include
                    textured
                    backgrounds for divs, icons for buttons, and banner images that aren't considered content. HTML tags
                    like the <.img> tag are often inserted as part of a web page and often occupy a significant portion
                    of it, so they have a significant direct impact on the layout. On the other hand, background-images
                    are often used for decoration and don't have a significant impact on the layout, but they don't
                    affect the document flow or the size of the element they're applied to.</p>
