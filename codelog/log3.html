	<h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>
	<h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
	<p>CSS media queries allow you to apply CSS only when the browser or device environment matches a specified rule.
		This CSS is a key element of responsive web design, allowing you to create different layouts based on the
		viewport size. It can also be used to detect other information about the environment your site is running in,
		such as whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.</p>
	<p>CSS media queries can be used in CSS code like this:</p>
	<textarea cols="50" rows="13">
		@media (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}
@media screen and (width: 600px) {
  body {
    color: red;
  }
}
</textarea>


	<p>By entering CSS media queries like this, you can create or complete websites with more colorful styles and
		layouts, or even something unexpected.</p>



	<h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries?</h2>
	<p>Media queries CSS support a wide range of features related to the user's viewport, device, and environmental
		settings. An example of this is responsive design. This design can take two approaches. The first approach is to
		start with the widest view, such as a desktop, and add breakpoints that move elements as the viewport gets
		smaller. Or, start with the smallest view, such as a mobile phone, and add layout there as the viewport gets
		larger. The second approach, called mobile-first responsive design, is generally the easiest and most suitable
		approach. Therefore, most people start with a mobile-first responsive design and then gradually move to a
		desktop-style responsive design.</p>
