	<h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>
	<h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
	<p>CSS media queries allow you to apply CSS only when the browser or device environment matches a specified rule.
		This CSS is a key element of responsive web design, allowing you to create different layouts based on the
		viewport size. It can also be used to detect other information about the environment your site is running in,
		such as whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.</p>
	<p>CSS media queries can be used in CSS code like this:</p>
	<textarea cols="20" rows="7">
		@media (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}
@media screen and (width: 600px) {
  body {
    color: red;
  }
}
</textarea>
	

	<p>By entering CSS media queries like this, you can create or complete websites with more colorful styles and
		layouts, or even something unexpected.</p>
