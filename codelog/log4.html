    <h1>CSS Color</h1>
    <h2>What do color, background-color, and border-color CSS properties do?</h2>
    <p>The CSS <.color> property is used to control the visual appearance of elements on a webpage by defining their
            colors. Using this property in your code allows you to apply color to various aspects of HTML elements, such
            as text, backgrounds, and borders, which can be one of the elements that makes webpages look great. The CSS
            <.background-color> property is used to set the background color of HTML elements. This property allows you
                to
                specify a solid color for the area behind the content of elements such as div, p, and body, which can
                then
                be displayed as a background color on web pages. The <.border-color> CSS property defines the border
                    color of an element. You can set the colors for all four sides of the border simultaneously, or
                    specify a different color for each side. This helps visually distinguish the border from the
                    background and surrounding content on a webpage.</p>
    <p>You can use the <.color> CSS to using the HTML code. Here is the example:</p>


    <textarea cols="60" rows="20">
    - Index 
        <div class="container">
    The color of this text is blue.
     
    <div class="child"></div>

    This block is surrounded by a blue border.
    
    </div>

    - CSS 
    .container {
        color: blue;
        border: 1px dashed currentColor;
}
     .child {
        background: currentColor;
        height: 9px;
}



		</textarea>

    <p>You can use the <.color> CSS (Including background-color and border-color) to using the <.div> code.</p>

    <h2>Named, Hexadecimal, RGB, and RGBA</h2>
    <p>First, named CSS represents color codes, such as red, black, and light green. Other colors, such as silver or
        purple, can also be used. This CSS allows you to manipulate colors simply by writing the color name. Hexadecimal
        colors are typically specified as #RRGGBB, where RR represents red, GG represents green, and BB represents blue,
        and are specified as color components in a hexadecimal integer. Therefore, when applying colors this way, you
        usually enter two fs in #000000 to specify the desired color. RGB color values ​​are specified using the rgb()
        function. RGB represents red, green, and blue, respectively. If you input the highest value of 255 or 100%, one
        of the three colors will appear. RGBA color values ​​are an extension of RGB color values ​​with an alpha
        channel, which specifies the opacity of an object. They are designated by the rgba function, with an "a" added
        to the end of the original rgb. The color input is almost identical to that of RGB color values, but the key
        difference is that an alpha parameter must be included. The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (completely
        transparent) and 1.0 (completely opaque).</p>
