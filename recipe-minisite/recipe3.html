			<h1>Gyeran Mari (Korean Rolled Omelette)</h1>
		</div>
		<section id="RecipeExplain3">
			<p>Egg rolls are one of Korea's most popular side dishes. Made with eggs and vegetables, the egg rolls are
				repeatedly rolled out thinly and fried. The finished omelet is then cut into thick, colorful slices,
				revealing a characteristically fluffy, spiral-shaped egg filling.</p>

		<section id="Recipein3">

			<li>4 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
			<li>&frac12; chopped medium size onion, minced</li>
			<li>&frac14; teaspoon ground black (or white) pepper</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon minced green bell pepper, optional</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon minced red bell pepper (or minced carrot), optional</li>
			<li>1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

			<h2>Directions</h2>
		</section>
		<section id="RecipeD3">
			<ul>
				<li>1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the salt. Beat with a whisk or a fork. Stir in the onion,
					ground
					black pepper. Add red and green bell pepper if you use. Mix it with a spoon. Put the vegetable oil
					in a small bowl and have a basting brush ready.</li>
				<li>2. Heat up a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is heated, lower the heat to
					medium low or low. Dip the brush into the oil and brush the skillet. Spoon about ⅓ of the egg
					mixture into the skillet. Spread the egg mixture evenly with the spoon into a thin, rectangular
					pancake. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom is set but the top is still a little runny.</li>
				<li>3. Lift up the right edge of the rectangle with your spatula and roll it up from right to left.
					Brush
					some oil on the cleared part of the skillet and move the rolled egg back to the right side of the
					oiled part of the skillet.</li>
				<li>4. Spoon half of the remaining egg mixture into the skillet, just to the left of the omelet roll so
					that the eggs run into the bottom edge and extend the omelet you already cooked, shaping it into a
					rectangle. Let this new layer cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until set on the bottom but still a little
					bit runny on top.</li>
				<li>5. Using a spatula, turn the rolled omelet over onto the new egg pancake and roll up the omelet from
					right to left. You will now have a roll on the left side. Brush the skillet with the remaining oil
					and push the omelet roll back over to the far right side.</li>
				<li>6. Repeat Step 4 with the remaining egg mixture. When the last layer has set, roll up the omelet
					again from right to left into a long, even, rectangular shape. Reduce the heat to low and cook,
					turning the omelet so that the 4 sides cook evenly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
				<li>7. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the omelet to a cutting board. If you need to shape
					it into a better rectangle, wrap in a gimbap mat and press and shape it with your hands. Let it cool
					for 5 minutes, then cut crosswise into ½ or ¾ inch slices and serve it with rice.</li>
