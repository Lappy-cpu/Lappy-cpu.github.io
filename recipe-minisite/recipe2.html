			<h2>Directions</h2>
		</section>
		<section id="RecipeD2">
			<ul>
				<li>1. Prepare the following, placing each ingredient into a separate pile on a baking sheet as you
					complete it: Trim the stems from 1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
					(about 6 cups); peel and cut 3 medium carrots into matchsticks (about 2 cups); cut 3 Korean or
					zucchini squash into matchsticks (about 3 cups); peel and cut 1 pound Korean or daikon radish
					crosswise into thin rounds, then stack them together and cut into matchsticks (about 4 cups).
				</li>
				<li>2. Bring a large saucepan filled three-quarters full with water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add
					1
					teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1 pound spinach in 2 batches. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
					wilted, about 2 minutes.</li>
				<li>3. Drain the spinach. When cool enough to handle, grab handfuls of the spinach, squeeze out as much
					water as possible, and place in a small bowl. Finely grate 1 of the garlic cloves on a Microplane
					onto the spinach. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the
					toasted sesame oil. Mix with your hands until combined.</li>
				<li>4. Fill the now-empty saucepan three-quarters full with water and bring to a boil over medium-high
					heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 12 ounces soybean sprouts. Cover and simmer, reducing
					the heat as needed, for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the remaining vegetables.</li>
				<li>5. Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in a large nonstick frying pan or cast iron skillet over
					medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the carrots and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Stir-fry
					until brighter in color and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Return to the baking sheet. Wipe out the
					pan with paper towels.</li>
				<li>6. Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in the same pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add
					the squash and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Stir-fry until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Return
					to the baking sheet. Wipe out the pan with paper towels.</li>
				<li>7. Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in the same pan over high heat until shimmering. Add the
					mushrooms, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of the toasted sesame oil. Finely grate 1 of the
					garlic cloves over the mushrooms. Stir-fry until the mushrooms are charred in spots, 4 to 5 minutes.
					Return to the baking sheet. Wipe out the pan with paper towels.</li>
				<li>8. Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the radish, 1/2
					teaspoon of the kosher salt, and 1/3 cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the radish is
					translucent and tender but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. When the radish is almost ready, add 1
					tablespoon of the toasted sesame oil and stir-fry for 1 minute more. Return to the baking sheet and
					reserve the frying pan.</li>
				<li>9. When the soybean sprouts are ready, drain and transfer to a medium bowl. (See recipe note for
					usages for cooking liquid). Finely grate the remaining garlic clove over the sprouts. Season with
					the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the toasted sesame oil. Mix
					with your hands until combined.</li>
				<li>10. Place 3 tablespoons of gochujang, the remaining 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, 2 tablespoons
					mirin, and 1 tablespoon honey in a small bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
				<li>11. Wipe out the reserved frying pan with a paper towel. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil
					in the pan over medium heat until shimmering. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom with the oil. Crack 4
					to 6 large eggs into the pan, spacing them evenly apart. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook
					undisturbed until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes.</li>
				<li>12. While the eggs are cooking, start to assemble the bibimbap. For each serving, place 1 cup hot
					cooked rice in a bowl. Divide and arrange the spinach, mushrooms, carrots, squash, sprouts, and
					radish in separate piles on the rice.</li>
				<li>13. Top each bowl with a fried egg and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Drizzle each bowl with 1
					to 2 tablespoons of the gochujang sauce and serve any remaining sauce on the side.</li>
